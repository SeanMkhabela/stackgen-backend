# Express Backend API

This is a simple Express.js backend API for the React frontend.

## Getting Started

Before running this backend, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on port 3000 (by default).

## API Endpoints

- GET `/api` - Returns a simple hello message

## Customizing

Feel free to expand this backend by:

1. Adding more routes
2. Connecting to a database
3. Implementing authentication
4. Adding middleware for request validation
